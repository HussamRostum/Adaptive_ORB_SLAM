# Adaptive_ORB_SLAM

As is widely known, ORB-SLAM algorithms suffer from significant limitations in dynamic environments, primarily due to their reliance on fixed parameters defined a priori. This causes them to perform poorly in changing lighting conditions or low-texture environments, where the number of key points detected decreases, negatively impacting the mapping and tracking processes. Classical ORB-SLAM algorithms also require parameter tuning manually, making them inefficient for real-time applications that constantly require adaptation. To solve this challenge, an adaptive method is proposed in which essential values are changed dynamically instead of fixed. By allowing these parameters to be adaptive, the research makes the ORB-SLAM algorithm more efficient and stable than the traditional ORB-SLAM algorithm. For example, when the number of key points found in a frame is too low, the system will redo feature matching and data extraction instead of continuing with too little information. This provides a credible map building and path point, resulting in a more solid and dependable SLAM system. This learning process renders the algorithm less sensitive to adverse conditions, such as low-texture scenes, changing lighting, and motion noise. Consequently, our method provides a more robust and efficient SLAM solution, especially for real-world applications where fixed parameter settings easily result in failure or inaccuracy.
